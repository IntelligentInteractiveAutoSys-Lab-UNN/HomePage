                    <h4>
                        Waste disposal and management is currently a critical environmental and societal challenge globally. Recently, coordinated global efforts have been 
                        championed by the United Nations (UN) to address the impacts of indiscriminate waste disposal and management on the ecosystems, human health, and the overall well-being of the planet.
                        This is because globally  an unprecedented amounts of waste annually, encompassing various types such as municipal solid waste, electronic waste, plastic pollution, and hazardous materials is generated annually.<br>
                        A recent study revealed that inadequate waste management practices like improper disposal and insufficient recycling contribute greatly to pollution and environmental degradation.
                        Unfortunately, urban centers in Nigeria are not left out in this menace.

                    <h4>
                        Poor drainage and waste management systems, unregulated urbanization, and weak implementation of urban masterplans in Nigeria are the major causes of the persistent flooding experienced in many cities across the country.

                    <h4>
                        The poor attitude of Nigerians to proper waste disposal has led to drainage blockages, poor sanitation practices, roadside dumping, canal dumping, and dumping in rains as is commonly practiced by urban slum dwellers.<br>
                        In many developed countries, flood risk management (FRM) which includes measures such as prediction of flood hazards, socio-economic factors and consequences aimed at reducing the likelihood and impact of floods have been developed to suit local context.
                        <br>Pertinent to mentions is the fact that many of these measures are pre-disaster measures. 
                        However, in Nigeria, governments at all levels have always focused on post-disaster flood response than control.

                        This project is a proactive effort towards ameliorating the adverse consequences of indiscriminate waste disposal such as flooding which frequently ravages our urban areas.<br>
                        Specifically, it aims to contribute towards realizing UN’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 11) through the design, development, and deployment of an autonomous 
                        human-robot collaborative system intended for promoting the campaign for responsible waste disposal in cities. The proposed robot will be equipped with functions for autonomous navigation, recognition and detection of indiscriminately disposed waste materials,
                        smart robotic arm for picking, sorting, and placing of waste in its collection system, and an interactive interface for sensitization, and elicitation of responsible waste disposal from users (See the figure below for a mini-prototype).

                    <h4>
                        Improper waste disposal remains a major challenge in urban centers in Nigeria. The prospects for autonomous robots as agents for sustainability drives have been explored in many developed countries where autonomous robots have been used to champion the call for proper waste disposal. 
                        Studies have shown that the interactive and persuasive capabilities of these robots have the potential to influence users during human-robot interaction (HRI) and human-robot collaboration (HRC) activities. 
                        However, little is known about how these robots can be leveraged for environmental conservation. Specifically, as it relates to motivating and encouraging users to engage in sustainable behaviors like proper waste disposal.  
                        In addition, the impact of adopting autonomous robots for collaborative tasks like campaigning for proper waste disposal from users in the Nigerian context is less established. 
                        Thus, as a first step in this direction, this project aims to develop an autonomous robot system to promote the call for responsible waste disposal practices. <br>
